The project includes the following steps:

1. Importing Libraries

Using pandas, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib.

2. Loading Dataset

Reading heart.csv and checking shape & first few records.

3. Data Cleaning

Removing duplicate rows

Handling missing values

Converting categorical columns using LabelEncoder


4. Exploratory Data Analysis (Optional for Week 14–18)

Distribution plots

Correlation heatmap

Feature relationships


5. Data Preparation

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

Train-test split (80–20)


6. Model Training

Algorithm used:

🟢 Random Forest Classifier
Selected because of high accuracy & low overfitting.

7. Model Evaluation

Metrics used:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report


8. Saving the Model

Saved using joblib:

heart_model.pkl
scaler.pkl
